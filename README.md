# Prospero3

Prospéro is a free and open-source platform for textual data analysis.
By combining natural language processing
and user-defined dictionaries to identify syntactic and semantic lexicons, it
allows to weight and classify thematic sets as well as argumentative and
narrative categories in time-evolving text corpora. Prospéro creators describe
it as a literary technology for social sciences.

## History
Prospéro 1 was designed as a desktop application in 1995 by the sociologist
Francis Chateauraynaud, director of studies at
EHESS,
and the software developer Jean-Pierre Charriau, also known as the former
bassist of Marie et les Garçons.
The version 2 of Prospéro with a client/server architecture was developed in
early 2010s with the contribution of Josquin Debaz, but it has never been
publicly released.
The collaborative project for Prospéro 3 has began in november 2019 during
a one-week seminar in Bayonne, southern
France, co-organized by GSPR and
Prefigura. This is the implementation of the
original theorical approach with advanced new features in a server-side
API and a
client-side web applicaton.
